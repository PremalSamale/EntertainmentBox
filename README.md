Welcome to the EntertainmentBox
==================================================

Getting Started
---------------

These directions assume you want to develop on your local computer, and not
from the Amazon EC2 instance itself. If you're on the Amazon EC2 instance, the
virtual environment is already set up for you, and you can start working on the
code.

To work on the sample code, you'll need to clone your project's repository to your
local computer. If you haven't, do that first. You can find instructions in the
AWS CodeStar user guide.

1. Install maven.  See https://maven.apache.org/install.html for details.

2. Install tomcat.  See https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/setup.html for
   details.

3. Build the application.

        $ mvn -f pom.xml compile
        $ mvn -f pom.xml package

4. Copy the built application to the Tomcat webapp directory.  The actual
   location of that directory will vary depending on your platform and
   installation.

        $ cp target/ROOT.war <tomcat webapp directory>

4. Restart your tomcat server

5. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a web browser to view your application.
