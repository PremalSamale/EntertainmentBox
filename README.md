industry is having high popularity. According to data provided by

2. High Level Design:
Entertainment Box movie service is developed using spring boot
technology for backend development on java language. Authentication
and authorization handled by Spring security for two types of user
customer and admin. AWS RDS is used for database. Hibernate to
query data from database. We have used AWS CodeStar which
manages software development activity such as develop, build and
deployment in one place. The application GitHub repository is
configured to AWS Code Star so that once code is pushed to master
branch it automatically gets deploy on AWS. This maintain the
continuous delivery of application. Below fig.1 shows the high-level
design of application from end to end.
